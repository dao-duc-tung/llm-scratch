# LLM from scratch

The goal is to build an LLM from scratch that does:

- Construct sentences in English without major grammatical flaws
- Generate a coherent response to my query
- No need to be factually correct
- Not too large in param size, less than 1B params
- 1024 context length

Setup environment:

```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.13.3 llm
pyenv local llm
```
